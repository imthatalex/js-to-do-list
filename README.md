Reminder:
- S.O.L.I.D Principles

Rules:
1. Use Objects : Factories or Classes/Constructors
2. Note Properties : Title, Description, Due Date, Priority
3. Ability to Create Seperate Projects : Default Project, Create Custom Project
4. Separate Application Logic : Modular
5. App Functionalty : View All Projects, View All Notes (Title & Description Only), Change Color of Background to Establish Priority, Edit Note, Delete Note
6. npm i date-fns
7. Use Web Storage API to Save Projects & Notes to Local Storage

W.I.L
- Composition over Inheritance : Use Smaller Functions (Code Blocks) to Create more Complex Behavior without having to write all the Code in one Large Function.
- Single Responsibility Principle : Similar Responsibilities with Only One Reason to Change
- How to Destructure Properties returned from Factory Functions
- Iterating with Nested forLoops : Multiple Arrays Require Multiple Loops
- When Passing Buttons with Attached Event Listeners as a Variable in Params, it May Cause Duplicate Event Listener Invocations
- Dealing with State should be Handled in Application Logic not Component Creation
- Using JSON to Stringify Objects & a Parser to Convert String Data back into an Object
- Using LocalStorage to Store Data Locally
- Update Locally Stored Data
- Array.Some() Method can Help Access Nested Properties to test Conditional Statements
- Using an Array Length as an ID Reference Point
- Creating an Index for Splice Array Methods using the index of a forLoop as a Reference Point
- IndexOf Method returns -1 when Element Not Found; Can Cause Unintended Behavior; Example : Removing Last Element from within a Splice Method
- When Removing Elements using a forLoop it's Best Practice to Decrease the Iterator not Increase
- Using Object.Assign() to Update Existing Object Properties or Add New Ones
- Using Array.Sort() to Sort Elements in an Array based on a Condition
- Using FindIndex to Test Whether an Element Exists and Fetch it's Index
